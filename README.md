# city-name-generator
Sirajology LSTM neural network that generates city names

See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvoZU-ItDiE

Based on the example from TF learn: https://github.com/tflearn/tflearn/blob/master/examples/nlp/lstm_generator_cityname.py

LSTM (Long-Short term neural network) article: http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/


Python the hard way... good book for learning python: https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

I still want to be able to use the trained neural network (files are saved but not uploaded to github)
